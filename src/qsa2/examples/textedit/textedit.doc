\title Text Edit Example

This Text Edit example displays a text editor with the user interface written
in pure C++.

The example adds the mainwindow of the application as an application
object. This makes all the signals, slots and properties of the
application's mainwindow and its children scriptable. Please note that
this is \e{bad practise} for more complex applications, because it
makes too much of the application's internal functionality available
to script programmers. However, it is a simple solution that may be
suitable for some applications.

Text edit also shows how to make a non \c QObject class available to
Qt Script. Consequently, it should be possible for the script writer
to implement a syntax highlighter which works on the current editor.
Qt already provides a class called \c QSyntaxHighlighter. To make this
class available, we implement a class called \c SyntaxHighlighter
which inherits \c QObject and \c QSyntaxHighlighter. We implement an
interface (public slots and signals) which makes the class scriptable
in the \c SyntaxHighlighter class. 

To allow the script writer to instantiate a syntax highlighter, the
class is made available to Qt Script where the class \c
ConstructorFactory inherits QSObjectFactory.

The text edit example already comes with one syntax highlighter
implemented in Qt Script. It is called DiffHighlighter and it
highlights uniformed diffs.
