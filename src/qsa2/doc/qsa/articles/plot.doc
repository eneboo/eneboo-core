\title The Plot Application

This article presents a usage case of QSA that goes beyond the
typical task of customizing an application. We will demonstrate Plot,
a small mathematical application that allows the user to write
formulas in Qt Script and visualize them using a one-dimensional
curve. The visualization functionality is the core part of the
application and it is implemented in C++. The user then uses Qt
Script to write the function which will be visualized. This article will show
how seamless Qt/C++ and Qt Script work together, and how little effort
is involved in making a C++ API available in Qt Script and calling Qt
Script functions from C++ code.

If you are unfamiliar with QSA, please read through the
introduction of the QSA documentation first to get an overview on how
Qt and QSA integrate.

The complete source code of the application can be downloaded from
\link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/plot.tgz here\endlink.

\section1 The Nuts and Bolts of the Plot Application

Plot allows the user to interactively input formulas. To acheive this,
the program provides interactive plot editors where Qt Script code
can be written. Using a simple function call, a given Qt Script
function will be vizualized.

To provide this function call in Qt Script, we use a class called
PlotObject, implemented in C++, with a function (C++ slot) plot()
which takes the Qt Script function as a parameter. The plot() slot
creates a widget to visualize the given Qt Script function. To
calculate the y-values for a certain x-value, the plot widget will use
QSInterpreter::call() to call the specified Qt Script function.

Before we go into more implementation details of the program, here is
a screenshot of Plot visualizing a sinus and cosinus function:

\section1 The main window

The Plot application consists of a main window which contains a
QWorkspace as central widget. All of the plot editors and the
windows visualizing functions can be contained inside the main window.

The only menu/toolbar option the application provides is \e New, which
opens a new plot editor.

At the bottom of the window there is a QTextEdit which displays error messages and
debug output.

The main window's code can be found in \link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/mainwindow.ui.h
mainwindow.ui.h \endlink. Although most of the code is
straightforward, we will look at some of the code in the file in more
detail when we have a look at the PlotEditor class.

\section1 The PlotEditor class

The PlotEditor class implements the interactive console which the user
of the application will mainly work with. It allows the user to
implement Qt Script functions and execute Qt Script calls. The code of
that class can be found in the files \link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/ploteditor.h
ploteditor.h\endlink and \link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/ploteditor.cpp ploteditor.cpp\endlink.

PlotEditor inherits QSEditor. QSEditor already provides an editor with
Qt Script support such as syntax highlighting, code completion,
etc. 

PlotEditor has one additional slot, called eval(), which evaluates Qt
Script code that has been entered. This slot is connected to the
returnPressed() signal of the editor, so that code is always evaluated
when the user presses return or enter.

Now we'll look at the implementation of the PlotEditor class. A
PlotObject is instantiated in the constructor. All code entered in
this editor should be evaluated in the context of that object and the
editor should use this object as the completion context. In addition
to providing a context for all code, which is essential in order to
avoid polluting the global context, this object provides the function
plot(), which the user will call to visualize a function. We'll
elaborate more on that later on in the article.

There is one important point to consider regarding code completion in
the editor. We allow the user to open multiple plot editors. QSA only
allows one QSEditor at a time to offer code completion. To start
completion in a QSEditor, you can call QSEditor::activate(). To stop
completion and allow another editor to start completion, you call
QSEditor::release().

What we want to do is to intercept window activation of our
QWorkspace, and call release() on the previously active editor, and
activate() on the newly active editor. To do this, we connect the slot
windowActivated() in \link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/mainwindow.ui.h mainwindow.ui.h\endlink to
the QWorkspace's windowActivated() signal and implement this
functionality there.

The only part missing from PlotEditor now is the eval() function,
which is called when the user presses return. The easy solution would
be to always evaluate the enitre buffer. But what we ideally want, is
to evaluate only the last code block, which the user was working
on. The eval() function implements a simple way to find this last
block. The algorithm isn't perfect, but it is good enough for our
purposes.

First, the function checks if the last entered line is in the middle
of a Qt Script function. It does that by checking if curly braces or
parentheses mismatch. If this is the case, we don't want to evaluate
any code and return. If this isn't the case, we can go on and try to
read the code backwards, until we either assemble a syntactically
correct code block, or we have to stop and return, since there is no
more code. In the event that we find a syntactically correct code
block, we evaluate this block.

To check code for syntactical correctness, we use
QSInterpreter::checkSyntax(), and to evaluate code, we use
QSInterpreter::evaluate().

\section1 The PlotObject class

The PlotObject class (\link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/plotobject.h plotobject.h\endlink and
\link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/plotobject.cpp plotobject.cpp\endlink) has already been
mentioned in the previous section. It serves two purposes:

\list 
\i It provides a context to execute code in order to avoid polluting
the global context.
\i It provides the plot() function which the user can call to
visualize a function.
\endlist

To provide a context, no code has to be written. The fact that
PlotObject is a QObject subclass takes care of that.

The plot() function is very simple too. It takes the name of the Qt
Script function which should be visualized, as an argument. plot()
then creates PlotWidget and passes the function parameter and the
context (which is 'this') on to the PlotWidget's constructor. plot()
also returns the PlotWidget it has created, so that the user can
change properties on the PlotWidget later from Qt Script.

\section1 The PlotWidget class

This PlotWidget class is the heart of the application. This widget can
visualize a mathematical function implemented in Qt Script. The
implementation can be found in the files \link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/plotwidget.h
plotwidget.h\endlink and \link http://doc.trolltech.com/qsa-1.1/plotwidget.cpp plotwidget.cpp\endlink.

We will not walk through the whole code of that widget, but only
discuss the most important parts.

First, PlotWidget defines some properties such as curveColor, labels
of the axis and the range of the x-axis. This way the user can
customize this widget from Qt Script.

Before the widget can draw anything, it has to calculate the y-values
for all x-values in the range which should be visualized. The
calculation is done in calculateValues(). This function iterates
through the x-range and calls calculateY() for every x-value and
stores the calculated y-value.

The real work is done in calculateY(). This function calls the Qt
Script function which the widget visualizes. This is done via
QSInterpreter::call(). The first argument is the Qt Script function to
call. The second one is a list of arguments which should be passed to
this function. In our case this is the x-value. The third (optional)
parameter is the context in which the function should be called. In our
case, this is the PlotObject which we got passed in the PlotWidget's
constructor.

QSInterpreter::call() returns a QVariant. We are interested in a
double value, so we call toDouble() on it and return that result.

The main work of the PlotWidget is done in the paintEvent() function
where the axis, labels and the actual curve is painted. But we will
not go through that code, since it is not relevant to QSA for this
example.

\section1 Final words

In summary, the Plot application is nothing more than a plain Qt/C++
application that uses the QSA library. This article shows how QSA can
be used to customize the application and give the user a lot of
flexibility without having to use wrappers. It further demonstrates
how to enable the user to call a C++ slot from Qt Script (plot()), how
to modify a C++ object from Qt Script (modifying properties of the
PlotWidget which is returned from plot()), and how to call a Qt Script
function from C++ including passing arguments to it and using its
return value (as used in calculateY()).

For an example of how to use the application, please look at the
screenshot. Basically every function which takes one input parameter
and returns a numerical value can be visualized using Plot.
