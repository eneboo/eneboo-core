\section1 Introduction

This guide presents \QSA, a tool for making C++ applications
scriptable, using \QS, an interpreted scripting language. Some basic
knowledge of scripting is needed to get the most out of this guide.

This guide provides an introduction to \QSA, and its tools. 

Here is a brief overview of the chapters:
