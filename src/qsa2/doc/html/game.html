<p> 
<p> The Game example demonstrates how to combine a
simple customizable widget with non trivial script code to
significantly increase the functionality of the widget.
<p> The Game example consists of two main parts: the Playfield and a
script file.  The C++ class <tt>PlayField</tt> contains a few properties and
functions that can be accessed by the script file and that offer some
basic game related functionality to the developer. The game script
file describes how the game works.
<p> <h2> The PlayField Class
</h2>
<a name="1"></a><p> The PlayField class is a simple game engine for playing sprite based
games. It contains functionality that makes it easy for game
developers to create game objects and to receive input from the
keyboard.
<p> Programming a game for the game engine is done by implementing three
stages. The first stage is initialization; this is where the script
loads the images that will be used in the game and adds them to the
PlayField for later use. This is done by calling the script function
<tt>init()</tt>.  The second stage is the game loop where the PlayField
runs a timer based loop that triggers every few milliseconds. Each
time the loop triggers the script, function <tt>next()</tt> is called. This
continues until the player either wins or looses and then the game calls
the function <tt>gameOver()</tt>. This will tell the game loop to stop. 
<p> The PlayField class has the following properties: 
<ul>
<li> up- True if the user presses the \Key up arrow key.
<li> down-True if the user presses the \Key down arrow key.
<li> left- True if the user presses the \Key left arrow key.
<li> right- True if the user presses the \Key right arrow key.
<li> space- True if the user presses the space button.
</ul>
<p> The PlayField class has the following script enabled functions:
<ul>
<li> int addItem( const QPixmap &m )- Adds a pixmap to the playfield and
returns its id.
<li> void moveItem( int id, int x, int y )- Moves the item with the
given id.
<li> void enableItem( int id, bool enable )- Sets if the item should
be painted or not.
<li> void gameOver( bool success )- Stops the game loop and displays a
win or loose "game over" message.
<li> void clear()- Clears all the pixmaps in the Playfield.
</ul>
<p> <h2> The Shooter Game Script
</h2>
<a name="2"></a><p> The shooter game is the epic tale of the heroic space commander battling the
alien armies in outer space. 
<p> The game is implemented using a Qt Script file that contains the game
logics. This includes moving the participants of the game around or
determining if a bullet shot hits or misses.
<p> As described above, the game is divided into three
stages. Initialization is implemented in the script function
<tt>init()</tt>. This function is called once before the game starts running,
and is used to load the images and move them to their desired
location on the screen. The second stage is the function <tt>next()</tt> which
is called for every step in the game loop. In this function the script
determines the actions of the player through the PlayFields
properties, then moves the player, enemies and bullets around and
checks for collisions. If an enemy is hit, it is disabled. If all
enemies are disabled the script calls the gameOver function with true,
indicating that the user won. If the player is hit, or the enemies get
past the player the script calls the function gameOver with the
argument false, meaning that the player lost.
<p> <h2> The Bouncer Game Script
</h2>
<a name="3"></a><p> In the Bouncer game script, the player takes on a gang of evil bricks
that just sit there. Your weapon is a ball that bounces around the
screen and deals damage to the bricks when it collides into them.
Smash all the bricks to win!
<p> The Bouncer game script is written in a more object-oriented way than the
shooter script; consequently it shows how to use classes and inheritance in
Qt Script. The base class is the <tt>GameItem</tt>, which contains a pixmap
and some encapsulation of the pixmap id etc. The player is implemented
in the <tt>Player</tt> class, which basically provides a specialized
constructor. The ball is implemented using the <tt>Ball</tt> class which
extends the GameItem with a speed vector, describing the direction and
speed of the ball. The enemies are implemented in the <tt>Brick</tt> class.
Each brick has three damage levels, each described by its own pixmap
and id. This is encapsulated in the <tt>Brick</tt> class.
<p> The initialization stage of the game <tt>init()</tt> creates the player,
ball and bricks. The bricks are then moved into place. While the
game loop is running <tt>next()</tt>, the game moves the player and the
ball. The player registers <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> buttons only, since 
the player can only move horizontally. When the ball is moved, we
check for collision with the player, which will bounce the ball back
up to the bricks, or collision with one of the bricks. If the ball
collides with a brick, it will damage the brick, which will 
change the pixmap of the brick as can be seen in the function
<tt>Brick.damage()</tt>. The game is over when the player either fails to 
bounce the ball, or manages to destroy all the bricks.
