-------------------------------------------

Make sure that the $QTDIR environment variable points to the Qt
installation directory and that $QTDIR/bin is in your PATH and
$QTDIR/lib has to specified in your library path.


Unix or Mac:

Use the executable installer.


For further information on Qt Script for Applications, 
see the README file.

--

QSA requires Qt, and works with Qt 3.1.2 and newer versions of the Qt
3.x series. It will not compile against Qt 4.

If you have not already done so, install Qt. On Windows start
the self extracting Qt package executable and follow the usual
installation process. On Unix or Mac untar the Qt package, cd into the
directory and follow with the usual installation process:
(./configure; make).

Note to users of Qt 3.2.3:
Qt Assistant shipped with 3.2.3 needs a patch for the documentation in QSA
to be properly installed for users of Mac and Unix. This is available
in the download directory.

Patch files are:
qt-mac-assistant-3.2.3-qsa-patch.sitx
qt-x11-assistant-3.2.3-qsa-patch.tar.gz
